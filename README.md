## My process
Here are the tools and technologies I employed to address this challenge, insights gained throughout the problem-solving journey, areas in which I aspire to enhance my skills in the coming days, and articles that proved beneficial for me, potentially aiding others in overcoming similar challenges on Frontend Mentor or elsewhere.

This is the approach I took to address this challenge. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Just realized I severely underestimated the 'max-width' property in CSS. It helped me lots in keeping the card responsive no matter the screen size.

Just this CSS rule changed EVERYTHING:

```css
.card{
  max-width: 337.5px;
}
```

Responsive design is getting more and more fun...can't wait for more...


### Continued development

I'm finally getting a grip on responsive design (With CSS FLexbox and Media queries)...I'll get there surely.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is was a clear and concise documentation that helped me lots during this challenge. I believe every web developer is familiar with it but I still need to mention it in case.
